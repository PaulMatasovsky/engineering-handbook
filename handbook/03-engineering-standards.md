# Chapter 03 — Engineering Standards

## Overview

Engineering standards provide consistency across projects.

While technologies and requirements evolve, consistent standards improve maintainability, communication, documentation, and overall software quality.

The standards defined in this chapter establish the minimum expectations for projects developed as part of this handbook and serve as the foundation for future work.

# Engineering Workflow

Every project should follow a deliberate progression.

Rather than moving directly from an idea to implementation, work should proceed through the following stages:

1. Understand
2. Design
3. Build
4. Verify
5. Improve

Each stage produces information that informs the next.

Skipping earlier stages often creates unnecessary complexity later.

---

## Stage 1 — Understand

Before implementation begins:

* Define the problem.
* Identify stakeholders.
* Understand business terminology.
* Identify assumptions.
* Record unanswered questions.
* Define project goals.
* Determine success criteria.

Questions should be documented before solutions are proposed.

---

## Stage 2 — Design

Design should simplify implementation.

During this stage:

* Evaluate architectural options.
* Define system boundaries.
* Organize repositories.
* Establish naming conventions.
* Identify documentation requirements.
* Record significant decisions as ADRs.
* Design for maintainability before optimization.

---

## Stage 3 — Build

Implementation should remain consistent with documented decisions.

Code should prioritize:

* readability
* maintainability
* modularity
* consistency

Projects should evolve incrementally.

Large changes are easier to manage when divided into smaller, reviewable improvements.

---

## Stage 4 — Verify

Verification extends beyond testing.

Verification includes:

* requirements validation
* exploratory testing
* smoke testing
* regression testing
* documentation review
* usability review
* architecture review

The objective is to confirm that the implemented solution satisfies the original problem.

---

## Stage 5 — Improve

Every completed project should produce new knowledge.

After significant milestones:

* document lessons learned,
* update project journals,
* revise documentation,
* improve templates,
* refine engineering standards,
* identify future opportunities.

Continuous improvement is an expected outcome rather than an optional activity.

---

# Documentation Standards

Documentation should exist alongside implementation.

Every significant project should include, when appropriate:

* README
* project journal
* architecture documentation
* roadmap
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
* testing documentation
* setup instructions
* future enhancements

Documentation should explain both *what* was built and *why* it was built that way.

---

# Repository Standards

Repositories should present a consistent structure whenever practical.

At a minimum, repositories should include:

* descriptive README
* appropriate licensing
* meaningful folder organization
* documentation directory (if needed)
* clear commit history

Projects should be organized for future maintainability rather than immediate convenience.

---

# Naming Standards

Consistency improves readability.

General conventions:

* lowercase repository names
* hyphen-separated repository names
* descriptive filenames
* meaningful variable names
* explicit terminology
* consistent domain language

Names should communicate intent rather than implementation.

---

# Decision Standards

Important technical decisions should be documented.

Each significant decision should record:

* context,
* decision,
* alternatives considered,
* reasoning,
* expected consequences.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) provide the preferred mechanism for preserving this information.

---

# Quality Standards

Quality expectations apply throughout development.

Every project should strive for:

* correctness,
* maintainability,
* simplicity,
* consistency,
* traceability,
* reproducibility,
* clear documentation.

Testing should verify documented expectations rather than undefined assumptions.

---

# AI Collaboration Standards

AI should support—not replace—engineering judgment.

Preferred AI responsibilities include:

* reviewing documentation,
* identifying inconsistencies,
* explaining unfamiliar concepts,
* generating initial drafts,
* suggesting improvements,
* reviewing architecture,
* assisting with repetitive tasks.

Important engineering decisions should remain subject to human review.

---

# Definition of Done

A project milestone should not be considered complete until:

* requirements are satisfied,
* documentation is current,
* significant decisions are recorded,
* testing has been completed,
* known limitations are documented,
* future work is identified where appropriate.

Completion includes documentation, not merely implementation.

---

# Continuous Refinement

These standards are expected to evolve.

As better practices are discovered through experience, the handbook should be updated to reflect those improvements.

Consistency is important.

Blind adherence to outdated standards is not.

Engineering standards should mature alongside engineering experience.
